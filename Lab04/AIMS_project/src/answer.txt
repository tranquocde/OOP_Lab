Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface ?
Answer: Media

Question: In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
Answer: public int compareTo(Media media) {
        return this.getCost() - media.getCost;
}

Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
Answer: No

Question: Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Answer: -> By using if/else, in first case, if 2 objects have the same title, we compare them by length and so on.
