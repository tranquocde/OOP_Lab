Question : After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 
Answer: Because Java is passing by value language, so everything happening inside the function does not affect the value outside the scope of the function

Question : After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 
Answer : Because we have updated the title of jungleDVD by the line of code "dvd.setTitle(title)". Then we change the reference of dvd to a new DigitalVideoDisc, but the value of jungleDVD is unchanged.
